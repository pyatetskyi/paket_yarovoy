# paket_yarovoy
Building a tool/solution based on text parsing and ML approaches.

## To start with...

1. Download and install git (you may use this link: https://git-scm.com/download)

2. Open cmd and go to the folder where you want to store this project

3. Create a copy of repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pyatetskyi/paket_yarovoy
   ```
4. Go to repository folder:

   ```
   cd paket_yarovoy
   ```
   
5. Check status:
 
   ```
   git status
   ```
   
   If everything went fine you will see this message:
   
   ```
   On branch master
   Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
   nothing to commit, working tree clean
   ```

## To commit...

1. Open cmd and go to the git folder for this project

2. Run this command:

   ```
   git add -A
   ```
   
3. Then run this command:

   ```
   git commit -m "Write usefule comments here"
   ```
   Notes: please do NOT write shitty senseless comments like "Adding changes to files" etc.
   
4. And finally run this command:

   ```
   git push
   ```
   
## To get latest version...

1. Open cmd and go to the git folder for this project

2. Execute this code:

   ```
   git pull
   ```
   Notes: it`s a good practice when every time before starting to work with files you retrieve latest version (if you do NOT have pending changes).
